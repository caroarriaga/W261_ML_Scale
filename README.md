## W261 Machine Learning at Scale
MIDS Program Spring 2022

This repo contains the exported files from databricks (ipynb), the plataform where the original files are stored.

Objective:
Use parallelize computing to train multiple classification models on large datasets (24m rows and 130+ features) to predict flight delays in the US.
