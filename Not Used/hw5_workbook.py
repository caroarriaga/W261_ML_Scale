# MAGIC %md # Question 1: Distributed Graph Processing
# MAGIC Chapter 5 from Lin & Dyer gave you a high level introduction to graph algorithms and concernts that come up when trying to perform distributed computations over them. The questions below are designed to make sure you captured the key points from this reading and your async lectures. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q1 Tasks:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ Give an example of a dataset that would be appropriate to represent as a graph. What are the nodes/edges in this dataset? Is the graph you describe 'directed' or 'undirected'? What would the average "in-degree" of a node mean in the context of your example? 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ Other than their size/scale, what makes graphs uniquely challenging to work with in the map-reduce paradigm? *(__HINT__: Do not respond in terms of any specific algorithm. Think in terms of the nature of the graph datastructure itself).*
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) short response:__ Briefly describe Dijskra's algorithm (goal/approach). What specific design component makes this approach hard to parallelize?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) short response:__ How does parallel breadth-first-search get around the problem that you identified in part `c`? At what expense?

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ### Q1 Student Answers:
# MAGIC > __a)__ Follower data for Instagram users. The users would be the nodes and the directed edges would be 'following'. The graph described is directed (if you follow someone, they don't necessarily follow you back), and the average 'in-degree' of a node would be the average number of followers that a user has. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __b)__ With graphs, we need to iteratively expand from a source node across the data. Because of this, we need multiple map-reduce stages for each layer of neighbors we traverse.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __c)__ The goal of Dijskra's algorithm is to find the shortest from a source node, to all other nodes in the graph.  The algorithm maintains a set of visited nodes, whose shortest path has already been calculated. In each iteration, the unvisited node with the shortest distance from the visited nodes is selected, it is inserted into the set of visited nodes and the distances of its neighbors are updated. The set of unvisited nodes is implemented as a priority queue, which means that the algorithm is sequential in nature. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __d)__ Parallel breadth-first-search allows you to process all nodes in the current frontier (unvisited nodes) in parallel, meaning that parts of the priority queue can be processed in parallel. If we implement this using a map reduce framework, then we need a map and reduce job for every layer in the graph. This can be expensive as we potentially need many shuffle and sort phases.  

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md # Question 2: Representing Graphs 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In class you saw examples of adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations of graphs. These data structures were probably familiar from HW3, though we hadn't before talked about them in the context of graphs. In this question we'll discuss some of the tradeoffs associated with these representations. __`NOTE:`__ We'll use the graph from Figure 5.1 in Lin & Dyer as a toy example. For convenience in the code below we'll label the nodes `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and `E` instead of $n_1$, $n_2$, etc but otherwise you should be able to follow along & check our answers against those in the text.

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q2 Tasks:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ Relatively speaking, is the graph you described in Figure 5.1 in Lin & Dyer "sparse" or "dense"?  Explain how sparsity/density impacts the adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations of a graph.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ Run the provided code to create and plot our toy graph. Is this graph directed or undirected? Explain how the adjacency matrices for directed graphs will differ from those of undirected graphs.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) code:__ Fill in the missing code to complete the function `get_adj_matr()`.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) code:__ Fill in the missing code to complete the function `get_adj_list()`.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ### Q2 Student Answers:
# MAGIC > __a)__ Sparse. Sparsity in adjacency matrixes leads to unnecessary increases in data size. Sparsity does not affect adjacency list represenations, just makes them that much more memory efficient than the adjacency matrix. If there is one very dense node however (with many out-nodes) then we would have an unbalanced adjacency matrix.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __b)__ Directed. The adjacency matrices for undirected graphs will be symmetrical whereas the directed graph will not be.

# MAGIC %md # Question 3: Markov Chains and Random Walks
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC As you know from your readings and in class discussions, the PageRank algorithm takes advantage of the machinery of Markov Chains to compute the relative importance of a webpage using the hyperlink structure of the web (we'll refer to this as the 'web-graph'). A Markov Chain is a discrete-time stochastic process. The stochastic matrix has a principal left eigen vector corresponding to its largest eigen value which is one. A Markov chain's probability distribution over its states may be viewed as a probability vector. This steady state probability for a state is the PageRank of the corresponding webpage. In this question we'll briefly discuss a few concepts that are key to understanding the math behind PageRank. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q3 Tasks:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ It is common to explain PageRank using the analogy of a web surfer who clicks on links at random ad infinitum. In the context of this hypothetical infinite random walk, what does the PageRank metric measure/represent?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ What is the "Markov Property" and what does it mean in the context of PageRank?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) short response:__ A Markov chain consists of $n$ states plus an $n\times n$ transition probability matrix. In the context of PageRank & a random walk over the WebGraph what are the $n$ states? what implications does this have about the size of the transition matrix?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) code + short response:__ What is a "right stochastic matrix"? Fill in the code below to compute the transition matrix for the toy graph from question 2. [__`HINT:`__ _It should be right stochastic. Using numpy this calculation can be done in one line of code._]
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __e) code + short response:__ To compute the stable state distribution (i.e. PageRank) of a "nice" graph we can apply the power iteration method - repeatedly multiplying the transition matrix by itself, until the values no longer change. Apply this strategy to your transition matrix from `part d` to find the PageRank for each of the pages in your toy graph. Your code should print the results of each iteration. How many iterations does it take to converge? Which node is most 'central' (i.e. highest ranked)? Does this match your intuition? 
# MAGIC     * __`NOTE 1:`__ _this is a naive approach, we'll unpack what it means to be "nice" in the next question_.
# MAGIC     * __`NOTE 2:`__ _no need to implement a stopping criteria, visual inspection should suffice_.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ### Q3 Student Answers:
# MAGIC > __a)__ In this hypothetical context of an infinite random walk, the PageRank metric is a measure of the visit rate of a page.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __b)__ The Markov property is that the next state of a system depends only on the current state of the system, and not on the sequence of events that happened previously. In PageRank, we also have this memoryless property, we only care about the current state of the graph that has been visited, when determining where to visit next. The PageRank algorithm is a sequence of discrete states that have the Markov Property.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __c)__ In the context of PageRank, the n states are the pages in the WebGraph. The more pages there are in the WebGraph, the greater the dimensions of the transision probability matrix will be.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __d)__ A right stochastic matrix is a square matrix of non-negative real numbers, with each row summing to 1.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __e)__ It takes around 5 iterations to converge. The most central node is 'E', which matches my intuition as node E has an in-node from every other node.

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Seems easy right? Unfortunately applying this power iteration method directly to the web-graph actually runs into a few problems. In this question we'll tease apart what we meant by a 'nice graph' in Question 3 and highlight key modifications we'll have to make to the web-graph when performing PageRank. To start, we'll look at what goes wrong when we try to repeat our strategy from question 3 on a 'not nice' graph.

Fill in the missing code to compute its transition matrix & run the power iteration method from question 3. What is wrong with what you see? [__`HINT:`__ _there is a visible underlying reason that it isn't converging... try adding up the probabilities in the state vector after each iteration._]
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__  Identify the dangling node in this 'not nice' graph and explain how this node causes the problem you described in 'a'. How could we modify the transition matrix after each iteration to prevent this problem?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) short response:__ What does it mean for a graph to be irreducible? Is the webgraph naturally irreducible? Explain your reasoning briefly.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) short response:__ What does it mean for a graph to be aperiodic? Is the webgraph naturally aperiodic? Explain your reasoning briefly.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __e) short response:__ What modification to the webgraph does PageRank make in order to guarantee aperiodicity and irreducibility? Interpret this modification in terms of our random surfer analogy.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ### Q4 Student Answers:
# MAGIC > __a)__ The probabilities in the state vector are getting smaller on each iteration, rather than converging. When looking at the sum of the probabilities in the state vector after each step, I can see that it is decreasing, instead of them adding up to 1.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __b)__ The dangling node in this graph is 'E', as it has no out-nodes, so once you arrive at it, there is no where to go next. This means that the probabaility attributing to the PageRank of node 'E' at each step is lost. We could modify the transition matrix at each iteration to fix this by identifying a row with all zero probabilities and instead assigning 1/N probability to each element in the row, where N is the total number of nodes in the graph. This is saying that we are equally likely to visit all nodes from this dangling node.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __c)__ A graph is irreducible if there is a path from every node to every other node. Webgraphs are not naturually irreducible, as they can contain dangling nodes.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __d)__ A graph is aperiodic if the greatest common divisor of all cycle lengths is 1. It seems that webgraphs _are_ naturally aperiodic graphs (in that they likely have disconnected cycles of coprime lengths), but not naturally aperiodic markov chains (which implies all states are aperiodic).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __e)__ To guarantee aperiodicity and irreducibility, PageRank introduces teleportation. This means that a random websurfer can either continue their walk to the next page as usual by clicking on a link, or with a certain probablility, they can type in a new url and 'teleport' to a new page. This teleportation removes danglers (making it irreducible) and it introduces self-arcs as there is now a chance of staying on the same page (making it aperiodic).

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC As you've seen in previous homeworks the computational complexity of an implementation depends not only on the number of records in the original dataset but also on the number of records we create and shuffle in our intermediate representation of the data. The number of intermediate records required to update PageRank is related to the number of edges in the graph. In this question you'll compute the average number of hyperlinks on each page in this data and visualize a distribution for these counts (the out-degree of the nodes).

# MAGIC %md # Question 7 - PageRank part 1 (Initialize the Graph)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC One of the challenges of performing distributed graph computation is that you must pass the entire graph structure through each iteration of your algorithm. As usual, we seek to design our computation so that as much work as possible can be done using the contents of a single record. In the case of PageRank, we'll need each record to include a node, its list of neighbors and its (current) rank. In this question you'll initialize the graph by creating a record for each dangling node and by setting the initial rank to 1/N for all nodes. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC __`NOTE:`__ Your solution should _not_ hard code \\(N\\).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q7 Tasks:
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ What is \\(N\\)? Use the analogy of the infinite random web-surfer to explain why we'll initialize each node's rank to \\(\frac{1}{N}\\). (i.e. what is the probabilistic interpretation of this choice?)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ Will it be more efficient to compute \\(N\\) before initializing records for each dangling node or after? Explain your reasoning.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) code:__ Fill in the missing code below to create a Spark job that:
# MAGIC   * parses each input record
# MAGIC   * creates a new record for any dangling nodes and sets it list of neighbors to be an empty set
# MAGIC   * initializes a rank of 1/N for each node
# MAGIC   * returns a pair RDD with records in the format specified by the docstring
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) code:__ Run the provided code to confirm that your job in `part a` has a record for each node and that your should records match the format specified in the docstring and the count should match what you computed in question 5. [__`TIP:`__ _you might want to take a moment to write out what the expected output should be fore the test graph, this will help you know your code works as expected_]
# MAGIC  
# MAGIC __`NOTE:`__ Please observe scalability best practices in the design of your code & comment your work clearly. You will be graded on both the clarity and the design.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ### Q7 Student Answers:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __a)__ \\(N\\) is the total number of nodes in the graph. We initialize each node's rank to \\(\frac{1}{N}\\) to simulate a "blank slate", where the surfer is equally likely to start on any page in the web graph.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __b)__ It will be more efficient to compute \\(N\\) after initializing records for each dangling node, since we can just run `count()` on the nodes after the initialization. Calculating \\(N\\) while initializing dangling node records would require some global count, which violates statelessness.

# MAGIC __`A Note about Notation:`__ The formula above describes how to compute the updated page rank for a node in the graph. The $P$ on the left hand side of the equation is the new score, and the $P$ on the right hand side of the equation represents the accumulated mass that was re-distributed from all of that node's in-links. Finally, $|G|$ is the number of nodes in the graph (which we've elsewhere refered to as $N$).
# MAGIC

# MAGIC

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) short response:__ Keeping track of the total probability mass after each update is a good way to confirm that your algorithm is on track. How much should the total mass be after each iteration?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) code:__ Fill in the missing code below to create a Spark job that take the initialized graph as its input then iterates over the graph and for each pass:
# MAGIC   * reads in each record and redistributes the node's current score to each of its neighbors
# MAGIC   * uses an accumulator to add up the dangling node mass and redistribute it among all the nodes. (_Don't forget to reset this accumulator after each iteration!_)
# MAGIC   * uses an accumulator to keep track of the total mass being redistributed.( _This is just for your own check, its not part of the PageRank calculation. Don't forget to reset this accumulator after each iteration._)
# MAGIC   * aggregates these partial scores for each node
# MAGIC   * applies telportation and damping factors as described in the formula above.
# MAGIC   * combine all of the above to compute the PageRank as described by the formula above.
